# Happy Tails

<b>Happy Tails</b> is a website designed for a dog shelter that helps adorable dogs find loving homes. Users can see available dogs, learn about the adoption process, get in touch with the shelter, and know about the events organized by the shelter.

## Page Structure

It has 4 HTML pages: Home, Meet the Pups, Contact, and Adopt.

## Home Page
- Introduces the purpose of the website.
- Table with upcoming events.
- Articles for raising awareness.

## Meet the Pups Page
- Details about the available puppies.

## Contact Page
- Multiple contact methods the user can choose from for convenience. (Telephone, e-mail, social media)
- Contact form for users to reach out.

## Adopt Page
- Sign Up and Login options for users. (To adopt, users need to have an account created to verify their identity and the contact methods.)

## Design Features

### Go to Top Button
- Uses an image of a paw as a button to navigate to the top.
- It appears on scroll.

### Pop-up message boxes
- When submitting forms (contact form, sign-up form, and login form), messages pop up in the boxes, and by clicking ok on those boxes, they go away without resetting the page.
(If backend development is implemented, we can collect the data from the users. ex: using a database)

### Consistent design and footer
- The footer is fixed at the bottom of the page.
- The navigation bar is fixed at the top of every page.
- Usage of limited colours that do not contrast with each other.
